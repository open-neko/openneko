# openneko

The OpenNeko operator CLI — a single Go binary that supervises the Docker
stack and manages sandboxed plugins. Same binary works on an operator's
laptop, on a self-hosted server, and inside the worker container.

## Install

One line, any platform:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openneko.app/install.sh | sh
```

The installer detects your OS/arch and installs via Homebrew on macOS or a
checksum-verified release tarball on Linux (amd64 / arm64). Then run the guided
`openneko setup`.

Manual:

- **macOS (Homebrew):** `brew install open-neko/tap/openneko`
- **Linux:** download the tarball from
  [github.com/open-neko/openneko/releases](https://github.com/open-neko/openneko/releases),
  verify it against `checksums.txt`, and put `openneko` on your `PATH`.

You also need Docker (Docker Desktop on macOS, Docker Engine on Linux).

## Usage

### Stack supervision

```bash
openneko [--instance name] setup [--mode prod|dev|demo] [--port N] \
  [--openshell-port N] [--bind-address IPv4] [--docker-subnet IPv4/24]
openneko instances                       # list configured installations
openneko start [--mode prod|dev|demo] [--detach]
openneko upgrade [--version vX.Y.Z] [--mode auto|prod|dev|demo] [--stack-only|--cli-only]
openneko stop [--volumes]
openneko status
openneko logs [service…] [-f]
openneko migrate
openneko seed adventureworks
openneko [--instance name] graphjin import <customer-config.yml|->
openneko backup {status,now,verify}
openneko backup key {export,adopt}
openneko reset [--all]
```

Modes:

- `prod` — core services only (default)
- `dev` — developer defaults; from a source checkout use repo-root `pnpm dev:setup` + `pnpm dev` for demo data and hot-reloaded web/worker
- `demo` — core + AdventureWorks trial bundle

The unnamed backward-compatible installation materializes its embedded Compose
files to `.openneko/runtime/` in the current working directory. A named
installation uses
`${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/openneko/instances/<name>/runtime/`, so
it can be managed consistently from any working directory. Its host config and
override live under `~/.config/openneko/instances/<name>/`. The CLI appends the
matching `compose.override.yml` automatically when present.

`graphjin import` accepts a YAML fragment containing `sources`, `tables`,
and/or `relationships`. Use `-` to read it from standard input. It requires a
running production installation and applies the update through GraphJin's
preview/apply path while preserving managed authentication and keystore settings.

Named instances allow multiple production stacks on one Docker host. Setup
persists the web/OpenShell ports and assigns an isolated Docker subnet; Compose
resources use `openneko-<instance>-<mode>`. Always pass `--instance <name>` to
lifecycle and plugin commands for that customer.

`openneko upgrade` resolves the latest stable release (or the exact
`--version`), updates the local CLI first, and re-executes that new binary
before it pulls service and agent/plugin-base images at the same tag. Keeping
the CLI and stack together matters because the CLI embeds the Compose topology
used to recreate the stack. Homebrew-owned CLIs are updated through Homebrew;
standalone CLIs use the release archive and `checksums.txt` before atomic
replacement. The command then recreates the recorded stack mode, runs
migrations, prunes old OpenNeko image tags, and persists the selected tag for
later starts.

Use `--stack-only` for a deliberately independent image upgrade (including a
custom non-release image tag), or `--cli-only` to update the operator binary
without touching Docker. A source-built `0.0.0-dev` CLI cannot self-update and
must use `--stack-only` or be replaced with a released CLI. Installations from
before this behavior need one final manual CLI update; subsequent
`openneko upgrade` invocations keep both sides aligned. Older installs without
a recorded mode are inferred from existing Docker Compose projects; pass
`--mode` only when multiple OpenNeko stacks exist.

### Backup encryption keys

Each backup repository has its own identity and encryption key. The repository
mapping and key fingerprint are kept in host state outside the bind-mounted
repository; the key itself is stored separately there and mounted read-only
into the database and backup containers. This also avoids rootful Docker
changing ownership of metadata the rootless host CLI must read.

Default repositories are isolated by Compose project and a persistent
installation ID under `~/.local/share/openneko/repositories/`. Named instances
therefore cannot attach their PostgreSQL clusters to another customer's
pgBackRest stanzas. `stop --volumes` and `reset` also rotate the installation
ID after deleting database volumes, so a new PostgreSQL cluster is never
pointed at the previous cluster's stanzas.

- Rootless Linux and macOS default to
  `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/openneko/backup-keys/`.
- A system service can set `OPENNEKO_BACKUP_STATE_DIR=/var/lib/openneko`.
- Set `OPENNEKO_BACKUP_REPOSITORY` to put encrypted backups on a NAS or another
  failure domain. Do not put the key directory inside that repository.

Export a recovery copy before moving or rebuilding the host:

```bash
openneko backup key export --to /secure/off-host/openneko-backup.key
```

Adopt that key after attaching an existing repository to a reinstall:

```bash
OPENNEKO_BACKUP_REPOSITORY=/mnt/openneko-backups \
  openneko backup key adopt --from /secure/off-host/openneko-backup.key
```

Adoption asks pgBackRest to validate legacy repositories before writing their
new identity marker. A missing or mismatched key fails closed and never causes
the CLI to generate a replacement key against existing encrypted backups.

### Plugin + skill management

```bash
openneko init
openneko install <name>[@<marketplace>] [--version <v>] [--unverified]
openneko install <git-url>[#<sub-path>]
openneko remove <name>
openneko list
openneko marketplace {list,add,remove}
openneko secrets {list,set,unset}
openneko doctor
```

Two install lanes:

1. **Marketplace (default)** — `openneko install <name>` resolves against
   trusted marketplaces, runs `npm install`, writes the manifest entry.
   `--unverified` bypasses every marketplace and installs directly from
   npm. Both gated by the deployment install policy at `/settings/security`.

2. **Git URL** — `openneko install <https-url>[#<sub-path>]` clones the
   URL (shallow), validates the agentskills.io-spec `SKILL.md` at the
   root or the given sub-path, and copies the folder under
   `~/.openneko/skills/<skill-name>/`. No plugin half, no npm install —
   for pure-procedural community skills. URLs must be https against
   github / gitlab / codeberg. Gated by `allowGitUrlInstalls`.

Packages whose `package.json` declares `openneko.skill: "./skill"` also
drop the bundled SKILL.md half under `~/.openneko/skills/<name>/` during
install — that's how connectors like Google Workspace and Shopify ship
their procedural-knowledge skills alongside their typed action handlers.

The binary manages three things on the operator's host:

- `openneko.plugins.json` (tracked) — installed plugins manifest; each
  entry carries `installSource` + `installedAt` + `policySnapshot` for
  audit.
- `~/.config/openneko/secrets.json` (mode 0600) — per-user env vars for
  static API keys, plus `_operators[opId][plugin]` slots for per-operator
  OAuth credentials produced by `connect`-capable plugins.
- `~/.openneko/skills/` — community + bundled-half skill folders the
  worker loads at agent-turn time. `pnpm skills:check` validates declared
  deps.

See the repo-root [README](../../README.md) for the full operator-side
docs including `/integrations` (per-operator OAuth) and `/settings/security`
(install-policy switches).
