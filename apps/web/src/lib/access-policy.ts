/**
 * One table for who may reach each route. The proxy applies it to every
 * request, and a path with no entry is refused, so a new route cannot ship
 * open by accident (test/lib/access-policy.test.ts fails on a missing entry).
 *
 * Route handlers keep their own checks. This table decides who reaches a
 * route; the handler still decides what that caller may see inside it,
 * including which items they hold.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - `public`: no session, e.g. the sign-in flow.
 * - `token`: the route authenticates its own caller, e.g. a workflow API key.
 * - `signed-in`: a valid session. Solo installs have one operator and pass.
 * - `admin`: a member of Administrators.
 *
 * Prefixes cover an area, so a new route inside one inherits its rule. A new
 * top-level area has no entry, and the test names it until it is listed.
