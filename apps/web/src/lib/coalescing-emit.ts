 * Buffers consecutive `message` events from the agent and persists them as a
 * single coalesced row, instead of one row per streamed delta. The previous
 * pattern (`emit` → `appendWorkRunEvent` per delta) was creating ~50-200
 * rows per logical assistant turn, which blew up `work_run_event` volume and
 * — because the rows were tiny and order-sensitive — surfaced ordering bugs
 * when re-fetched.
 *
 * Behavior:
 * - `message` events of the same role accumulate into an in-memory buffer.
 * - Any non-`message` event flushes the buffer first (so ordering is stable),
 *   then persists itself.
 * - The buffer also flushes on an idle timer (default 250ms) so the live SSE
 *   subscriber stream still feels alive.
 * - A role flip (assistant → user, rare) flushes the prior role's buffer.
 * - `finalize()` drains any pending buffer; callers MUST await it in their
 *   `.finally()` block.
 *
 * Live SSE clients see the coalesced message events through
 * `notifyRunSubscribers` at flush time — they get one larger delta per
 * ~250ms instead of many tiny ones. The visual UX is "phrases appearing"
 * vs. "tokens appearing," which is acceptable for the chat experience and
 * unblocks both storage and ordering wins.
