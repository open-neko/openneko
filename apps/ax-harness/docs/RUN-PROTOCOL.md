# Run protocol

Ax Harness runs one agent turn per process. The host writes one JSON run
specification to stdin. The harness writes one JSON event per line to stdout.
The host owns history, compaction across turns, approvals, the sandbox and
scheduling.

Build the binary with `go build -o bin/ax-harness ./cmd/ax-harness`.

## Input

Send exactly one object, at most 16 MiB. Unknown fields fail the run.

| Field | Type | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | integer | Must be `1`. |
| `run_id` | string | Required. 128 characters or fewer. |
| `input_id` | string | Required. 128 characters or fewer. |
| `prompt` | string | Required. It carries the whole turn, including history. Only the model context window bounds it. |
| `stream_responses` | boolean | Optional. Sends live `answer.delta`, `thought.delta` and `actor.step` events. |
| `timeout_ms` | integer | Optional. Run wall clock, 1,000 to 1,800,000. Default 540,000 (9 minutes). |
| `max_actor_steps` | integer | Optional. Actor steps, 1 to 500. Default 25. |
| `max_child_steps` | integer | Optional. Child agent steps, 1 to 500. Default 50. |
| `max_operations` | integer | Optional. Tool calls per run, 0 to 4,000. 0 means no cap. |
| `max_model_calls` | integer | Optional. Model calls per run, 0 to 2,000. 0 means no cap. |
| `max_model_tokens` | integer | Optional. Token ceiling, up to 10,000,000. 0 means no ceiling. |
| `max_cost_micros` | integer | Optional. Cost ceiling in USD micros. Needs a priced route profile. |
| `reasoning_effort` | string | Optional. `low`, `medium` or `high`. |
| `context_window_tokens` | integer | Optional. The model context window. A prompt larger than this estimate fails before any model call. |
| `max_output_tokens` | integer | Optional. Maximum output tokens per model call. Must be below `context_window_tokens`. |

## Limits

The limits match Hermes, so the two backends behave the same.

| Limit | Ax Harness | Hermes equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prompt size | Model context window only; 16 MiB stdin sanity limit | No fixed cap; `model.context_length` |
| Context window, output tokens | `context_window_tokens`, `max_output_tokens` | `model.context_length`, `model.max_tokens` |
| Actor steps | Default 25, 1 to 500 | `agent.max_turns` 25; OpenNeko per-run override |
| Child agent steps | Default 50, 1 to 500 | `delegation.max_iterations` 50 |
| Tool calls, model calls | No cap unless set | No separate caps |
| Run wall clock | Default 9 minutes, maximum 30 minutes | OpenNeko turn timeout, 9 minutes |
| Actor code time | The run wall clock, including tool waits | No separate limit |
| Inline tool result | 100,000 characters | `DEFAULT_RESULT_SIZE_CHARS` |
| Saved result preview | 1,500 characters | `DEFAULT_PREVIEW_SIZE_CHARS` |
| Inline results per actor step | 200,000 characters | `DEFAULT_TURN_BUDGET_CHARS` |
| Stored tool result | 16 MiB; MCP results 8 MiB, below the MCP SDK frame limit | Spilled to a file |
| Terminal timeout | Default 180 s, maximum 600 s | `TERMINAL_TIMEOUT` default 180, `FOREGROUND_MAX_TIMEOUT` 600 |
| Terminal output | 50,000 characters, head and tail | `DEFAULT_MAX_BYTES` 50,000 |
| File read | 100,000 characters, 2,000 lines, 2,000 characters per line | `_DEFAULT_MAX_READ_CHARS`, `DEFAULT_MAX_LINES`, `DEFAULT_MAX_LINE_LENGTH` |
| File write and edit | 1 MiB of content; readable files up to 10 MiB | No direct equivalent |

A result above the inline limit, or above the step budget, returns a run-local
reference with a preview. Actor code reads the full result with
`harnessSavedOperation(id)`.

## Output events

Every event has `version`, `run_id`, `input_id`, `sequence` and `type`.
`sequence` counts up from 1. Model events carry no prompt text. No event carries
credentials. `tool.finished` carries the tool result in `data`.

| Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `run.started` | The run started. |
| `child.admitted` | The run has a read-only child agent. |
| `model.request.started` | A model call passed admission. `name` is the configured model, `origin` the route, `provider` the provider type, `call_id` the count. |
| `model.request.finished` | A model call ended. `usage` holds the tokens, `observed_model` the model the provider reported, and `error` is set on failure. |
| `model.route.fallback` | A transient provider error moved the call from `name` to `origin`. |
| `executor.step.failed` | Actor code failed. Later executor calls can use the escalation route. |
| `skill.used` | The agent declared that the staged skill `name` influenced the turn. |
| `tool.input.rejected` | Tool input failed its schema. The tool did not run. |
| `tool.started`, `tool.finished` | One tool call, with `operation_id`, `effect` and, when finished, `data` or `error`. |
| `observation.retrieved` | Actor code read a saved tool result by `operation_id`. |
| `span.started`, `span.finished` | Ax span lifecycle. |
| `child.started`, `child.finished` | Child agent lifecycle. |
| `run.finished` | The last event. `result` holds the outcome. |

Live events have `sequence` 0 and appear only with `stream_responses`. Treat
them as provisional; only `run.finished` holds the answer.

| Type | `data` |
| --- | --- |
| `answer.delta` | `{version, index, text}` from the responder. A new `version` replaces the earlier text. |
| `thought.delta` | `{version, index, text}`. Provider thought summaries, from Anthropic and Gemini routes with `reasoning_effort` set. |
| `actor.step` | `{text}`. The short request the actor writes when it hands work to the executor. |

## Result

| Field | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `status` | `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled` |
| `kind` | `answer`, `summary`, `clarification`, `failure` |
| `answer` | The final text, unchanged, with any fences. |
| `code` | Set when the run did not complete, or names the budget for a `summary`. |
| `usage` | Requests, reported calls, tokens and `coverage`: `complete`, `partial` or `unavailable`. |
| `cost` | Present when `max_cost_micros` is set. |

A tool error is a normal result. The model sees it and can adapt; the run does
not fail because of it.

When the run stops at `max_operations`, `max_actor_steps` or `max_model_calls`,
the harness makes one more model call with no tools. That call answers from the
tool results. The result is `completed` with kind `summary` and code
`operations_exhausted`, `actor_steps_exhausted` or `model_calls_exhausted`.
When `max_model_calls` is set, the agent stops one call early to keep that call
inside the cap. A token, cost, deadline or cancel stop never makes this call.

Failure codes: `model_failed`, `model_http_<status>`, `model_context_overflow`,
`model_output_truncated`, `actor_steps_exhausted`, `operations_exhausted`,
`model_calls_exhausted`, `invalid_output`, `model_budget_exceeded`,
`model_token_budget_exceeded`, `cost_budget_exceeded`, `deadline_exceeded`,
`cancelled`.

A tool with effect `pause` ends the turn as `clarification` with the answer
"Awaiting operator input."

## Exit codes and signals

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | The run completed. |
| 1 | The run did not complete, or event delivery failed. |
| 2 | The input or the configuration is invalid. Nothing ran. |

SIGINT and SIGTERM cancel the run. The run then finishes with status
`cancelled`.

## Model configuration

The host sets the model. Run input cannot change it.

- One model: `HARNESS_MODEL`, `HARNESS_MODEL_API_KEY`, and optionally
  `HARNESS_MODEL_PROVIDER` and `HARNESS_MODEL_URL`. `HARNESS_MODEL_URL` is
  required for the default provider, `openai-compatible`.
- Several routes: `HARNESS_MODEL_ROUTES`, a JSON object:

```json
{"context":"cheap","executor":"work","responder":"work",
 "fallbacks":[{"from":"work","to":"spare"}],
 "routes":[
  {"key":"cheap","model":"model-a","url":"https://provider.example/v1","api_key_env":"HARNESS_CHEAP_KEY"},
  {"key":"work","provider":"anthropic","model":"model-b","api_key_env":"HARNESS_WORK_KEY"},
  {"key":"spare","provider":"google-gemini","model":"model-c","api_key_env":"HARNESS_SPARE_KEY"}]}
```

`provider` is `openai-compatible` (the default, which needs `url`) or any Ax
provider, for example `anthropic`, `google-gemini` or `openai`. A native
provider uses its default URL when `url` is absent. An unknown provider is a
configuration error.

`executor_escalation` and `executor_after_errors` (1 to 8) name a stronger
executor route after actor-code errors. `pricing_version` and a `price` on
every route enable the cost ceiling. Each route names the environment variable
that holds its key. Ax client retries are off; the harness owns fallback.

`reasoning_effort` sets `reasoning_effort` on OpenAI routes and Ax's thinking
budget on other providers. Anthropic routes use the prompt cache.

## OpenNeko entry

`cmd/ax-harness` reads these environment variables:

| Variable | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `OPENNEKO_MCP_ORG_ID`, `OPENNEKO_MCP_THREAD_ID` | Required run scope. |
| `OPENNEKO_MCP_BRIDGE` | Path of the OpenNeko MCP bridge. Starts `node` with it. |
| `OPENNEKO_MCP_SERVERS` | Comma list of bridge servers to start. |
| `OPENNEKO_BROKER_URL`, `OPENNEKO_BROKER_TOKEN` | Passed to the bridge only, then removed from the harness process. |
| `OPENNEKO_HARNESS_WORKSPACE_DIR` | Adds `file_read`, `file_edit`, `file_write`, `file_search`. |
| `OPENNEKO_HARNESS_SHELL` | `1` adds `terminal`. Needs the workspace. |
| `OPENNEKO_HARNESS_UPLOADS_DIR` | Adds read-only upload tools. |
| `OPENNEKO_HARNESS_SKILLS_READ`, `OPENNEKO_MCP_SKILLS_ROOT` | Adds the staged skills to the Ax skills catalog, and `skill_read` and `skill_search` for supporting files. |
| `OPENNEKO_HARNESS_CHILD_READS` | Comma list of read tools for the child agent. |

`terminal` runs `/bin/sh -c` in the workspace in its own process group. A
timeout or a cancel kills the whole group. Its environment has no broker
binding and no model credential: the entry removes `OPENNEKO_BROKER_URL`,
`OPENNEKO_BROKER_TOKEN`, `HARNESS_MODEL_API_KEY`, `HARNESS_MODEL_ROUTES` and
every route's key variable. A non-zero exit is a normal result with
`exit_code` and `output`.
