  return `<data_access>
The configured GraphJin database is the authoritative source for operational
questions. When the user attaches a file or explicitly references uploaded
data, read the file and use it as the source of truth for that turn. Otherwise
default to the database.
Delegate database discovery and querying by calling \`${agentTool}\` once with:

  {
    "instruction": "<the complete metric question, including the exact time window, aggregation, comparison baseline, grouping, and values needed for the output>",
    "maxSteps": 6
  }

GraphJin's built-in agent performs catalog-first discovery, validates its
queries, executes them under the configured source identity, and returns a
typed response containing status, answer, data, and evidence. The trusted
OpenNeko host selects the source, verifies that GraphJin's server agent is
globally read-only, and keeps its credential outside your sandbox.

Your instruction must be self-contained. Include the card title and rationale,
state that dates must be anchored to the latest date in live data, request the
current value and a comparable baseline in the same run, and ask for the
smallest grouped result that can populate chartData. Do not ask GraphJin to
format the final OpenNeko JSON object; you own that output contract.

Use response.data and response.evidence as the basis for every number. The
answer field explains the result but is not a substitute for evidence. If the
response is blocked, denied, has errors, or lacks enough evidence, do not
invent a metric. Retry only when its structured refusal says retryable and
gives a concrete lawful unblock step.

No direct GraphQL tool, GraphJin CLI, shell, raw HTTP, configuration, or write
path is available in this treatment. Do not try to bypass the delegated tool.

Include these correctness constraints in the delegated instruction when they
apply:

The configured GraphJin server is the authoritative source for operational data.
Its complete caller-visible MCP tool catalog is brokered into this run with the
native tool names and schemas. The source URL and short-lived
${queryIdentity === "actor" ? "actor credential" : "service credential"} never enter your sandbox.

For a goal-driven request, start with \`${catalogTool}\` using the user's natural
language instruction. When the tool list has no \`${catalogTool}\`, start with
\`${helpTool}\` and \`for\` set to \`discovery\` instead:

  { "search": "<the user's business question>" }

Inspect the best returned row with \`{ "id": "<returned id>" }\`. For complete
table columns, query kind \`column\` filtered by the returned table_name; for
joins, search kind \`relationship\`. Use \`${helpTool}\` with \`for\` set to
\`discovery\`, \`schema\`, \`query\`, or \`mutations\` only when intent-first
catalog search does not provide enough guidance. Never guess a table, field,
relationship, or GraphJin operator.

Validate non-trivial filters with \`${validateTool}\`. Prefer an approved saved
query through \`${savedQueryTool}\` when the catalog supplies one. Otherwise,
execute GraphQL by calling \`${queryTool}\` with:

  { "query": "<your GraphQL operation>" }

GraphJin itself applies the caller's role, source capabilities, and tool gates.
Treat a refusal or unavailable tool as authoritative; do not bypass it with the
shell, raw HTTP, a CLI, or a hand-written MCP request.
