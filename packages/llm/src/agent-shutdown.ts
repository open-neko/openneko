/**
 * Backend-agnostic registry of in-flight agent calls.
 *
 * Each backend, when it starts a long-running agent invocation, registers
 * a cancel callback (kill the spawned process tree, abort the SDK
 * AbortController, etc.) and removes itself when the call completes.
 *
 * The worker calls `cancelAllAgents()` from its SIGTERM handler before
 * pg-boss `stop({graceful:true})` so jobs fail fast instead of blocking
 * the systemd unit past its TimeoutStopSec.
 *
 * Why this is necessary: agent backends spawn external CLIs (hermes,
 * claude) which fork their own subprocesses (Python venvs, browser
 * tools, etc.). Some of those grandchildren detach themselves and
 * survive even systemd's cgroup SIGKILL, leaving orphan processes
 * across redeploys. Application-level cancellation is the only reliable
 * fix; relying on cgroup teardown alone has proved flaky in practice.
