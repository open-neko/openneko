/**
 * @neko/llm — shared LLM machinery: providers, agents, classifier.
 *
 * Both apps/web (sync RPC: classify, provider-test) and apps/worker (job
 * handlers: profiler, industry-researcher, bootstrap-metrics-writer,
 * metric-agent) consume this package. Keeping it shared lets the web app
 * call LLM functions in-process instead of round-tripping through the
 * worker over HTTP.
