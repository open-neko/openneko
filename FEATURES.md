## Ask anything, get real answers

Talk to your company data the way you'd talk to an analyst. The assistant
finds the right tables on its own, double-checks its work, and presents
results as readable cards and charts — not raw data dumps.

| Feature | What it does for you | Shipped in |
|---|---|---|
| The Ask workspace | A persistent chat surface with threads, run history, and shareable per-thread URLs — your conversations with your data are first-class records, not ephemeral sessions. | #2, #4 |
| Live streaming runs | Watch the assistant work in real time — messages and tool activity stream in as they happen, and cancel takes effect instantly. | #3, #5 |
| Self-correcting answers | When a query comes back wrong or empty, the assistant notices, fixes its approach, and retries — instead of handing you a broken result. | #96 |
| Smart discovery | The assistant learns the paths through your data that answer common questions for your role, so repeat questions get faster and more reliable. | #96 |
| Rich answer cards | Answers arrive as tables, charts, and summary cards designed for the screen you're on, not walls of text — with headings scaled for conversation, not billboards. | #4, #78, #129 |
| On-demand data knowledge | Instead of a stale schema snapshot, the assistant carries a compact live map of your data — hub tables, join paths, query patterns — and looks up details exactly when it needs them. Answers reflect your data as it is today, at the speed of the old pre-loaded packs. | #96, #129, #132 |
| Hours-saved tracking | Every answer and action estimates the specialist time it saved you; a "Time saved" tile rides each thread and a live dashboard sparkline adds it up — value in hours, not vibes. | #88, #94 |
| A memory that works by meaning | Teach the assistant a fact once and it recalls it by meaning, not keywords — memory is embedding-backed and saved/searched by the agent itself. | #17 |
| Briefing → deep dive | Any briefing card opens into a full Ask thread seeded with that card's context — from "what's this number?" to a real investigation in one click. | #8 |
| Editable business profile | The assistant's understanding of your company is right there to read — click into it and edit it like a document. | #10 |
| Same brain on every backend | Hermes and Claude backends have feature parity, including the full administrative toolset — pick your model without losing capability. | #3, #4, #112 |
| Information-dense Compact mode | A density toggle switches the whole app between a comfortable reading layout and an information-dense operator view. | #88 |

## Connect your data, conversationally

Hooking up databases and shaping who can see what no longer requires editing
config files. An admin does it from chat; the assistant proposes, the admin
approves.

| Feature | What it does for you | Shipped in |
|---|---|---|
| Chat-first data sources | Register, enable, disable, or switch your data connections by asking — the assistant proposes the change as a card, and an admin approves it. | #96 |
| Chat-first source configuration | Admins can add data sources, define roles, and set read/write access on the data engine itself from a conversation — no YAML, no redeploy. | #101 |
| Credentials stay out of chat | Passwords and keys are never typed into the conversation. They're entered once in a secure form, referred to by name afterwards, and stored sealed — the assistant never sees the value. | #101 |
| Personal access passes | Every request to your data carries a short-lived pass identifying who's asking and what they're allowed to see — access is per-person, not one shared key. | #96 |
| Multi-tenant isolation | In shared deployments, every query is automatically fenced to your organisation's rows — no way to read a neighbour's data. | #96 |

## It works while you're away

OpenNeko isn't just question-and-answer. It runs an operating loop —
observe, understand, decide, act — watching metrics, surfacing findings,
and proposing actions, with brakes so it never runs away from you.

| Feature | What it does for you | Shipped in |
|---|---|---|
| The operating loop | Workflows observe your data on schedules, surface findings as observations, and propose actions through an approval stack — the full loop from data to decision. | #11 |
| Morning briefing | Important observations are elevated into briefing cards — a short, prioritised read on what changed and what needs you. | #11, #96 |
| At-a-glance stats | A four-number strip (runs, findings, approvals waiting, budget used) tells you the state of your assistant in two seconds. | #96 |
| Build workflows by chatting | Create, update, and look up workflows and approval rules in the same chat where you ask questions — every artifact links back to the conversation that produced it. | #46 |
| Retire workflows by @mention | Delete a noisy or obsolete workflow mid-conversation by @mentioning it — composer autocomplete included. | #110 |
| Row-level data triggers | Workflows fire the moment a row changes — stock dips below its reorder point, an account flips to at-risk — not just on a schedule. Wired in plain language when you save the workflow. | #50, #52, #63 |
| Watchers | Set a condition in plain language — "tell me if daily orders drop below 500" — and the assistant monitors it and alerts you when it trips. | #96 |
| Outside-world triggers | External systems can ping OpenNeko to kick off a workflow — so it reacts to events, not just schedules. | #96 |
| Action receipts | When a rule auto-approves an action, the receipt doesn't vanish — every fired action has a deep-dive page showing what ran, why, and on whose authority. | #15 |
| Code actions | The assistant can file issues and draft code patches as proposals — a human always reviews and applies them. | #96 |
| Mute and pause | Tired of a noisy topic? Mute it, or pause the assistant for the day with one tap — it resumes on its own tomorrow. | #96 |
| Safety brakes | Daily run budgets and fan-out caps mean a misbehaving workflow runs out of rope quickly instead of flooding you. | #11 |
| "Seen 3× today" dedupe | Repeat findings collapse into one card with a counter, instead of stacking up as noise. | #96 |

## Meet your team where it works

OpenNeko lives in your chat tools, knows who's talking, and routes messages to
the right workspace.

| Feature | What it does for you | Shipped in |
|---|---|---|
| Slack, WhatsApp & Telegram | Talk to your assistant from the tools your team already uses — replies are formatted natively for each app. | #68, #96 |
| Channels are plugins | Each chat tool is a plugin behind one modality-free interface, so new channels arrive without core changes — and install through the same CLI as everything else. | #68, #70 |
| Zero-config inbound | Install a channel and it just starts listening — inbound polling auto-enables and the first contact auto-binds to your workspace. No env flags. | #72 |
| It knows who's asking | Every inbound message is tied to the actual sender, so permissions and personalisation follow the person, not the channel. | #96 |
| Workspace routing | Messages from a connected Slack workspace or phone number land in the right organisation automatically. | #96 |
| Identity linking | Chat accounts link to OpenNeko accounts — automatically by matching email, or with an admin's approval. Unlinked strangers get safe, read-only treatment. | #96 |
| Channel administration from chat | Admins can list workspaces, see who's linked, and approve or revoke links — all conversationally. | #96 |
| Per-channel rendering | Answers are composed for the surface they'll appear on — cards on the web, native formatting in chat apps — from one channel-neutral brain. | #88 |

## Built for teams

Every run knows who started it and what they're allowed to do. Admin work —
people, plugins, channels — happens in chat with explicit approvals.

| Feature | What it does for you | Shipped in |
|---|---|---|
| Enterprise SSO as a plugin | Install an auth plugin (Scalekit today; the contract fits Okta/Auth0/Keycloak) and "Sign in with…" lights up — no core rebuild. | #22, #24 |
| Real roles | Admins, members, and automated services each have distinct permissions, enforced everywhere — not just labels. | #96 |
| Every action has an owner | Whether something was started by a person in chat, a schedule, or a channel message, the record shows who and in what capacity. | #96 |
| Manage people from chat | Invite teammates, change roles, deactivate accounts — proposed by the assistant, approved by an admin. | #96 |
| Manage plugins from chat | Browse, install, and remove integrations conversationally, with each plugin's permissions shown on the card before you approve. | #96 |
| Personas | Tell OpenNeko what you do in your own words — free text, not a dropdown — and it tailors its briefings, language, and priorities to your role, from onboarding onwards. | #96, #120 |

## Yours and your team's knowledge

The assistant's memory, workflows, and settings are versioned like a careful
editor's drafts — personal by default, shareable on purpose, and always
restorable.

| Feature | What it does for you | Shipped in |
|---|---|---|
| Invisible versioning | Every change to skills, workflows, and memory is snapshotted automatically — nothing is ever lost to an edit. | #96 |
| Personal workflows | Your saved workflows are yours; the team's are the team's. Same name, no collisions. | #96 |
| Personal memory layer | Correct or hide a team memory just for yourself without changing it for anyone else — and pull in team updates when you want them. | #96 |
| Save, history, restore | Browse what changed and roll back to any earlier state of your assistant's configuration. | #96 |
| Promote and adopt | When a personal workflow or memory proves valuable, an admin can promote it to the whole team with full lineage of where it came from. | #96 |

## Security you can verify

The assistant is treated as untrusted by design: it runs in a locked-down
sandbox, never holds your keys, and leaves a tamper-evident trail you can
hand to an auditor.

| Feature | What it does for you | Shipped in |
|---|---|---|
| Always sandboxed | The AI agent and every plugin run inside isolation boxes with networking denied by default — this is the only mode, not an option you might forget to turn on. | #82, #96, #98 |
| Your keys never enter the box | API keys are injected on the wire by a gateway outside the sandbox; the agent only ever holds a placeholder. Verifiably — you can grep the box and find nothing. | #82 |
| Secrets encrypted at rest | Tokens, passwords, and keys are encrypted on disk everywhere they're stored. | #96 |
| Bring your own vault | Plug in an external secrets manager (Infisical) instead of local files, with no change to how anything else works. | #96 |
| Approval gates | Anything that changes the world — sending, installing, configuring, inviting — becomes a proposal a human approves first, governed by per-organisation policies. | #11, #96 |
| Dual-identity audit | Every privileged call records both the human behind it and the agent acting for them — no anonymous actions. | #96 |
| Tamper-evident log | The action trail is hash-chained: any edit or deletion after the fact is mathematically detectable. Exportable for auditors and SIEM tools. | #96 |
| Memory integrity | Stored memories are sealed against tampering and expire on schedule — a poisoned or stale note can't quietly steer the assistant. | #96 |
| Behavioral alarms | Unusual volumes — too many actions per hour, too many memory writes — raise alerts automatically. | #96 |
| Security profiles | One dial — solo, team, org, or hardened — scales approval strictness and alarm sensitivity to your deployment. | #96 |
| Audit in plain language | Ask "what did the assistant do yesterday and who approved it?" and get a readable timeline. | #96 |

## Plug in anything

Integrations are sandboxed plugins: installed in one command, hot-reloaded
without restarts, and governed by the same approval policies as everything
else.

| Feature | What it does for you | Shipped in |
|---|---|---|
| Sandboxed plugin system | Every plugin runs in its own isolation box with only the network egress its manifest declares — a misbehaving integration can't reach anything you didn't grant. | #20 |
| Hot-reload registry | Install, remove, or rotate a plugin's secrets and the running system reconciles itself — no worker restart. | #20 |
| Plugin actions as agent tools | Installed plugins surface their actions directly to the assistant, complete with example payloads so even small models call them correctly. | #24, #66 |
| Per-person integrations | Each operator connects their own accounts (OAuth) on the /integrations page — tokens are stored per-person, never shared. | #42 |
| Install policy | Admins decide who may install what; the policy is enforced at the CLI, the worker, and the web UI. | #42, #44 |
| Community plugins | Install straight from a git URL — the marketplace is a convenience, not a gate. | #42 |
| Always-current integrations | Deploys upgrade installed plugins to the latest marketplace release automatically. | #65 |

## Install in one command, operate calmly

A single binary brings the stack up, keeps it honest, and tells you the
truth when something is wrong — in language an operator can act on.

| Feature | What it does for you | Shipped in |
|---|---|---|
| The `openneko` binary | One Go binary supervises everything: start/stop/status/logs, migrations, seeding, plugins, secrets, doctor. No Node toolchain required to operate. | #26 |
| One-command sandboxed install | `openneko start` brings up the full stack — agent sandbox gateway included — with migrations applied before anything that needs them. | #82, #49, #54 |
| A demo with living data | The trial workspace ships with simulated sales trickling in and scripted scenarios firing, so briefings move and workflows have something real to find. | #47, #118, #121 |
| Honest status | `openneko status` probes what's actually serving — failures read as what they are (transient, cosmetic, or real) instead of all looking fatal. | #86 |
| Releases that gate themselves | Every release is installed and smoke-tested after it builds; a broken one is automatically demoted so installers always get the last good version. | #86, #105, #106, #107 |
| Deploys follow smoked releases | Production updates only when a release has passed its smoke — never on raw merges. Disk is garbage-collected on the way. | #116, #124, #125, #127 |
| Zero-click release cycle | Merge to main and the pipeline does the rest: version cut, binaries, images, smoke, deploy. | #16, #45, #92, #93 |
| Setup wizard you can trust | Rotating the database password in the wizard propagates everywhere — seeds, gateway, agent runs all keep working. | #121, #125 |
| Survives flaky networks | Image builds retry through registry hiccups; channel polling backs off and dedupes instead of log-flooding. | #80, #84 |
| Diagnosable agent failures | When an agent run dies, the error names the real cause — exit signal, memory state, the agent's own last log lines — and turn timeouts say "timeout", not mystery. | #129, #132 |
