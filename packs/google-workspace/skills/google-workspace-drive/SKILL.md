# Use Google Drive

Search files with `listDriveFiles`, then confirm IDs and current parents with
`getDriveFile`. Use permission reads before changing sharing.

Use the `google_workspace.drive` action. `create_file` creates file or folder
metadata. `copy_file` copies an existing file. `update_file` changes metadata;
to move a file, pass the new folder ID as `addParents` and the current folder ID
as `removeParents` in `query`. Permission operations create, update, or delete a
specific permission.

The approval intent must name each file ID, old and new parent for a move, or
the recipient and role for sharing. Avoid `anyone` and domain sharing unless the
user states that scope. This pack does not upload binary content.
